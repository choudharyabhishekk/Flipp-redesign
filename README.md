# Flipp Website Redesign

Welcome to the **Flipp Website Redesign** project repository! This project is a redesign of the Flipp website, which was originally built using WordPress. As one of my most-used apps, I decided to undertake this redesign as part of a college project to showcase my web development skills.

## 📜 Project Overview

Flipp is a popular app that helps users find savings and deals from various retailers. The original website was functional but lacked a modern, responsive design. This project focuses on creating a new, user-friendly design with improved aesthetics and responsiveness.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Custom Design**: Redesigned using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for a fresh, modern look.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Fully responsive design to ensure a seamless experience on all devices.
- **No Frameworks**: Built from scratch with **pure CSS**, without relying on external frameworks like Bootstrap.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Simplified navigation and improved visual hierarchy for better usability.

## 🖥️ Technologies Used

- **Create React App**: Used for setting up the development environment.
- **HTML5**: Structured and semantic markup for the website.
- **CSS3**: Pure CSS for styling, animations, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Added interactivity where necessary.
