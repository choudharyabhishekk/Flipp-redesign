# Flipp Website Redesign

Welcome to the **Flipp Website Redesign** project repository! This project is a redesign of the Flipp website, originally built with WordPress. As one of my most-used apps, I decided to redesign it using React as part of a college project to showcase my web development skills.

---

## 📜 Project Overview

Flipp is a popular app that helps users find savings and deals from various retailers. The original website was functional but lacked a modern, responsive design. This project reimagines the website with a fresh design and improved responsiveness, built entirely with **React**.

---

## 🛠️ Features

- **Custom Design**: Redesigned using **React** and **CSS** for a dynamic, modern look.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Fully responsive layout that adapts to any screen size.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Built with reusable React components for modularity and scalability.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Simplified navigation and improved visual hierarchy for better usability.
- **Performance Optimization**: Lightweight React application optimized for speed and performance.

---

## 🖥️ Technologies Used

- **React.js**: Core library for building the user interface.
- **CSS3**: Pure CSS used for styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Logic and interactivity.
- **Create React App**: Boilerplate for setting up the development environment.

---

## 🌟 Key Highlights

1. **React-Based Design**: Leveraging React components for an interactive and maintainable web application.
2. **Mobile-First Approach**: Optimized for mobile devices first, ensuring a seamless experience across all platforms.
3. **No External CSS Frameworks**: Styled with pure CSS to maintain control over design details.
4. **Real-World Inspiration**: Designed with insights from being an avid Flipp user.
